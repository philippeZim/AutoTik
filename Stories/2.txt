I Ghosted My Best Friend Because She Got Cancer, and I Don’t Know If I Can Fix It
[Regret]

Today’s her 30th birthday, and I didn’t call. Didn’t text. Didn’t even like her post on Instagram where she’s smiling with a stupid sparkly hat, bald head shining under the lights, surrounded by people who actually showed up. I haven’t talked to her in two years, not since she told me the diagnosis. Stage 3 breast cancer. And I just… disappeared.

We’d been best friends since we were 12. She was the loud one, always dragging me to parties I’d never go to otherwise, making me laugh until I couldn’t breathe. I’m quiet, awkward, the kind of person who’d rather stay home with a book than deal with people. She balanced me. She got me. We’d talk about everything—boys, dreams, how we’d get out of our shitty little town one day. She was supposed to be a chef; I was supposed to write novels. We had plans.

Then she called me that day, voice shaking, and said, “They found a lump. It’s bad.” I said all the right things—I think. “You’re strong, you’ll beat this, I’m here for you.” But I wasn’t. I couldn’t handle it. The hospital visits, the chemo updates, the way her voice got weaker every time we talked. I’d see her name pop up on my phone and my chest would tighten, like I couldn’t breathe. I’d tell myself I’d call back later, but later never came. I stopped replying. Stopped showing up. She’d text me stuff like, “Miss you, where you at?” and I’d just… stare at it. Then delete it.

I told myself it was because I was busy. Work was crazy, I was dating this guy (who turned out to be a jerk anyway), life was moving fast. But that’s bullshit. I was scared. Scared of watching her die, scared of how it’d feel if she didn’t. Scared of being the one who had to hold her hand through it when I could barely hold myself together. I’d see her posts online—pictures of her in a hospital gown, still smiling somehow, surrounded by family and friends I didn’t even know she had. And I’d feel this hot, ugly jealousy. Like, who were these people? Why didn’t I know them? But I did that to myself. I left.

The last time she reached out was a year ago. A voicemail. “Hey, it’s me. I’m in remission. Thought you’d want to know. I’d love to see you.” I listened to it three times, crying in my car outside the grocery store, and then I deleted it. Didn’t call back. I don’t know why. I think I was ashamed by then, too deep in the hole I’d dug. How do you say, “Sorry I abandoned you when you needed me most, I’m a coward”?

Today, scrolling through my feed, I saw her birthday pics. She looks good. Thin, but good. Her hair’s growing back, this cute little pixie cut. She’s laughing with a cake that’s got too many candles. And I’m sitting here alone in my apartment, 29 years old, no boyfriend, no plans, just a bottle of cheap wine and this gnawing pit in my stomach. I could’ve been there. I should’ve been there.

I keep thinking maybe she hates me now. Maybe she doesn’t even think about me anymore. Maybe she’s better off without me, because what kind of friend does that? Just vanishes when shit gets real? I don’t know if I can fix it. I don’t know if she’d even want me to try. But I miss her. God, I miss her so much it hurts. I miss her dumb jokes and the way she’d force me to dance even though I suck at it. I miss who I was when I was with her.

I’m not looking for sympathy. I know I’m the asshole here. I just needed to get this out because it’s eating me alive. I think I’m going to text her. Just “Happy birthday.” See if she replies. I don’t deserve it if she does, but I’m so tired of running from this.

Edit (March 08, 2025): I texted her last night. “Happy birthday, I’m so sorry, I miss you.” I didn’t sleep, just stared at my phone, expecting nothing. She replied this morning: “Holy shit, I thought you were dead! Thank you. Can we talk?” I cried so hard I scared my cat. We’re meeting for coffee tomorrow. She said she was hurt, but she never stopped loving me. I don’t know how she can forgive me, but she’s giving me a chance. I’m terrified and so fucking grateful. I’m not going to screw this up again. Thank you, whoever’s reading this, for letting me spill my guts here. It pushed me to do it.
