Title: TIFU by Accidentally Starting a Rumor That My Boss Was a Serial Killer

Posted by u/SpilledCoffeeChaos

Intro:

Okay, so I screwed up BAD yesterday—like, "I might actually get fired" bad. It all started with a spilled coffee and ended with half my office thinking our boss is secretly Dexter. Buckle up, because this is a wild ride.

Body:

So, I work at this boring little accounting firm. Yesterday morning, I’m rushing in, juggling my coffee and a stack of files, when I trip and spill my latte ALL over my desk. Papers? Soaked. Keyboard? Fried. My coworker Jake sees the chaos and goes, “Whoa, looks like a crime scene over here!” I laugh and say, “Yeah, better not tell the boss, or he’ll bury me out back with the others.” You know, just dumb sarcasm to lighten the mood.

Except Jake’s eyes go wide. He whispers, “Wait… what others?” I roll my eyes and say, “Relax, I’m kidding. He’s not actually a serial killer.” But Jake’s already typing on his phone, and I don’t think anything of it.

Fast forward to lunch. I’m in the break room, and everyone’s acting WEIRD. My coworker Sarah won’t even look at me, and this guy Tom keeps asking random questions like, “Hey, uh, how long has Mr. Daniels been here?” I’m confused, but then I overhear Jake at the coffee machine: “She said ‘the others.’ I’m telling you, she KNOWS something.”

Oh no. OH NO. I realize Jake’s turned my stupid joke into a full-on conspiracy. I try to fix it, cornering him like, “Dude, I was joking! Tell everyone it’s fake!” He just smirks and goes, “Too late. It’s already on the group chat.”

By 3 p.m., the office is BUZZING. People are whispering about “mysterious late-night meetings” and how Mr. Daniels “always wears gloves in winter.” Someone even digs up an old photo of him holding a shovel at a company picnic and posts it with “Suspicious much??” I’m dying inside, thinking, I’ve accidentally started a witch hunt.

Then Mr. Daniels calls me into his office. I’m sweating bullets, expecting to be fired—or worse. He sits me down, looks me dead in the eye, and says, “So… I hear I’m a serial killer now?” I stammer, “I-I swear it was a joke!” He just laughs—LAUGHS—and goes, “Honestly, it’s the most exciting thing to happen here in years. Keep it going, but maybe don’t tank my reputation, yeah?”

Resolution:

I dodged a bullet, but now half the office still side-eyes Mr. Daniels, and Jake’s calling me “The Whistleblower.” I’m terrified this rumor’s gonna spiral even more. TIFU big time. So, Reddit, how do I un-ruin my life—or should I just lean into it and start a true crime podcast?
