Accidentally Starting a Cult at My Yoga Studio

Okay, Reddit, I need to preface this by saying I am not a charismatic leader type. I'm a 26-year-old, slightly awkward yoga instructor with a crippling addiction to iced coffee and a tendency to trip over air. But today, I fucked up. Royally.

It started innocently enough. My studio, "Zenith Yoga," was struggling. Attendance was down, and my boss (who's basically a human stress ball) threatened to replace our Vinyasa Flow with "Hot Pilates Power Hour" if things didn't improve. Shudders.

So, I decided to spice things up. I'd been reading this book about ancient mantras and their supposed power to manifest desires. I figured, what the hell, let's try one. During savasana (the final resting pose), I chanted this mantra I found – something about "awakening the inner sun" and "embracing cosmic abundance." It sounded pretty, and I figured it would be a nice, relaxing change.

Except… it wasn't just relaxing.

The next day, three students came up to me, eyes wide, practically glowing. "That mantra… it changed me," one whispered. Another claimed they'd manifested a parking spot right in front of the studio (a miracle in our neighborhood). The third said they felt "a surge of pure, unadulterated energy" and promptly signed up for five more classes.

I was… confused, but also secretly thrilled. Word spread. Fast.

Within a week, my classes were packed. People were bringing crystals, wearing matching headbands (which I definitely didn't suggest), and chanting the mantra everywhere. The studio lobby started to resemble a new-age bazaar, complete with homemade kombucha and unsolicited aura readings.

Then came the "Inner Sun Salutations." Someone (I swear, not me!) created a whole new sequence of poses based on the mantra's supposed meaning. They were… intense. Lots of chanting, some interpretive dance, and a final pose that involved balancing on one foot while humming the tune of "Happy Birthday."

My boss, initially ecstatic about the increased revenue, now looks like he's aged ten years. He keeps muttering about "liability" and "fire hazards" (someone brought incense… lots of incense).

The peak of the madness? Yesterday, a group of students presented me with a hand-knitted shawl, calling me "The Sun Goddess" and asking for my blessing to open a "Zenith Yoga Satellite Studio" in their backyard.

I'm hiding in the supply closet right now, sipping my iced coffee and contemplating a career change. Maybe goat farming? At least goats don't expect you to manifest parking spots.

TL;DR: Tried a new mantra in my yoga class to boost attendance; accidentally created a cult-like following, and now I'm apparently a "Sun Goddess" who needs to bless backyard yoga studios.
