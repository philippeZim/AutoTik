Spitting in a Customer’s Ice Cream

Alright, buckle up, because today I royally fucked up in a way I never saw coming. I’m still shaking from how this spiraled, and I need to vent before I lose my mind.

I (22F) work at this little ice cream shop in my town—think retro vibes, overpriced scoops, and a constant stream of entitled customers. It’s usually fine, but yesterday I hit my breaking point. This dude—let’s call him Chad (40sM)—comes in, and from the second he walks through the door, he’s a nightmare. Snapping his fingers at me like I’m a dog, barking, “Hurry up, princess, I’ve got places to be,” and complaining the line’s too slow (there were two people ahead of him). Then he orders a triple scoop—chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry—in a waffle cone, but here’s the kicker: he demands I “make it quick” and “don’t skimp,” while glaring at me like I’m personally offending him by existing.

I’m fuming, but I plaster on my customer-service smile and start scooping. That’s when he leans over the counter, watches me like a hawk, and goes, “You’re doing it wrong. That scoop’s too small. What, you trying to rip me off?” I swear, I saw red. My manager’s in the back, the shop’s empty except for this jerk, and something in me just… snapped.

So, I did it. I turned my head, pretended to cough, and spit right into his chocolate scoop. Not a loogie, just a quick pthh—enough to mix in without him noticing. I topped it with the vanilla and strawberry, handed it over with my sweetest “Enjoy, sir!” and watched him strut out, licking away like he’d won the lottery. I felt gross but triumphant. That was that—or so I thought.

Here’s where the fun begins. Turns out, Chad wasn’t just some random asshole. Oh no, that would’ve been too easy. About an hour after he left, my phone buzzes with a notification from our shop’s Google reviews page. I check it, expecting maybe a one-star rant about “slow service” or “overpriced cones,” but instead, it’s a full-on novel titled: “Health Hazard Alert – Disgusting Employee Behavior.” My stomach drops. This dude didn’t just write a review—he posted a blurry photo of his half-eaten cone with some cryptic caption like, “Something tasted off… and I know why.” Then, in the review, he claims he “saw me do something unsanitary” and that he’s “reporting this to the health department AND his lawyer.”

I’m freaking out now. Did he see me? I was so careful—or at least I thought I was. The shop was dead, no cameras behind the counter (thank God for cheapskate owners), and I’d turned my head like a pro. But what if he’s bluffing? What if he tasted it? Can you even taste spit in chocolate ice cream? My mind’s racing, and I’m scrubbing the counter like I can erase the last two hours of my life.

My manager comes out from the back, oblivious, asking why I look like I’ve seen a ghost. I mumble something about “a rude customer” and pray she doesn’t check the reviews. She doesn’t—yet—but I know it’s only a matter of time before this blows up. Chad’s review already has two upvotes by the time my shift ends, and I’m paranoid he’s got friends in town who’ll spread this like wildfire.

I get home, still shaking, and spill the whole thing to my roommate, Jess (23F), who’s equal parts horrified and cackling. “You spit in it? Oh my God, you’re unhinged,” she says, scrolling through the review on her phone. “This guy sounds like a prick, though. Maybe he deserved it.” She’s trying to make me laugh, but I’m too busy googling “can you get fired for spitting in food” and “jail time for food tampering.” The answers aren’t pretty—apparently, it’s a felony in some states. A FELONY. I’m 22, I’m not built for prison!

By midnight, I’m refreshing the review page like a maniac. Chad’s added an update: “Contacted the owner. Expecting a full investigation. Stay tuned.” My heart’s in my throat. The owner’s a hardass who once fired a guy for eating a scoop of rocky road on shift—spitting in a customer’s cone might actually give him a heart attack. I’m debating whether to confess preemptively or just ghost the job entirely and move to Canada.

Then, at 1 a.m., my phone lights up with a text from an unknown number: “I know what you did, princess. You’re gonna regret it.” It’s got to be Chad—same condescending vibe, same “princess” jab. How the hell did he get my number? Did I leave a receipt with my name on it? Did he stalk me online? I’m spiraling, imagining him showing up at my apartment with a lawsuit or, worse, a baseball bat.

Now it’s morning, and I’m supposed to open the shop in an hour. I haven’t slept, I’m chugging coffee like it’s water, and I’m one Google search away from buying a wig and changing my identity. Do I go in and face the music? Do I call in sick and hope this dies down? Or do I track down Chad and beg him to drop it before he ruins my life over a $7 ice cream cone?
