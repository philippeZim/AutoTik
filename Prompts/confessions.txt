Example 1:

Today’s my 28 birthday and I am going to end it tomorrow

Hi I am 28 M and it’s 12:25am, I didn’t got a single call, I have tickets for Coldplay concert for 26 Jan, my favourite band and I don’t want to attend it cause I have 3 extra tickets but not even a single friend agreed to go to that concert with me, and I booked those in hope that someone will come, seats are block b lower ww 100- ww103, if you find all those seats empty understand that I am gone! And it’s not because I didn’t want to attend that concert, I really wanted that, but not even one of my friend agreed, it’s not about the concert only, I am a person who lives alone and my family lives in a different town, I see people on their birthday getting tagged in shit ton of stories or post, but no one ever tags me, i didn’t even got a call from my family I had a friend who used to call it at exactly 12 but today I didn’t even get that call, I asked my office colleagues to celebrate my birthday with me and I will sponsor liquor’s and cakes and everything yet they said they had plan for weekends, i hope I am not a terrible person, I think I am but I always wished people on time, I never purposefully hurt anyone but if I did I am sorry, I never did that though, I think they did not like how I look maybe, I have vitiligo and I am not that successful for my age, because I am little under confident, is that why people hate me, I don’t know why people hate me cause if I am unsuccessful I can be successful but that’s not it, maybe they hate that I have vitiligo, maybe that’s the reason, but I didn’t ask for it, I just got it, but can people just hate me just because I have vitiligo, I think so, I wouldn’t hate anyone though, I love all kind of people even the one who literally beaten the shit out of me when I was school because I got offended cause they were making jokes on my skin condition, maybe I shouldn’t got offended at that time, and they were only having fun I could have ignored them or maybe laughed with them, that might have resulted in a good friendship maybe, they might have wished me, I think I was always the problem, that’s why not even my parents loves me as they love my brother, he’s successful, he’s abroad with his wife and a dog, they are amazing, they didn’t wish me though it’s okay it’s still not over his office hours he is 6 hrs behind so he might have forgotten and it’s Okay, he’s busy, but he was the only one who understood me, but then when he got married and he got busy and it’s understandable, hope he becomes more successful, even last year he forgot my birthday, because he had this big project he was working, my friend that always called me he didn’t call though, he said he was travelling, might be that, I think people forget me cause I am not that important, and that’s fine I don’t add anything but only takes, I think I am Terrible for not adding value in life of people maybe after that only people will call me on my birthday, but I think it’s too late now cause I think if I leave now, no one would be that hurt as they already created distance from me, and they won’t feel sad, i am a terrible person and maybe that’s why my ex called got married to someone else, she took a right decision who wants a person who will always be vulnerable infront of them, although I was strong when she told me that she’s getting married in 3 weeks, and her roka is day after tomorrow, I didn’t shed a single tear and didn’t uttered an emotional word, I just left saying congratulations enjoy your life, she might thought I am heartless, well I was heartbroken not heartless but I can understand her POV, I think you can understand why I am a terrible person, and isn’t it better to sleep forever not knowing what happened to you

Edit: I don’t know what to write now?

Just that there are literally close to 2k people that actually wanted to be my friend and wished me, I was crying last night that not even single person called or messaged and I woke up with so many wishes, my phone is heating because of all the notifications I have been getting

I woke up and it’s 7:25 am exactly 7 hours when I started writing that post, and I think this could have been the best thing I can ask for!

I saw few comments that people want to come and attend concert with me and I would definitely love that

Everyone thank you so much in understanding, I will go through each comment and will try to reply all 200+ of you in my dm

I just can’t believe last night I was feeling extremely lonely while looking at this screen and typing this and right now there are 2000 people who are there for me rooting for me from the same screen, thank you so much Reddit for showing me that world is not that bad as I thought it was!!!!

Thank you everyone

This is definitely some kind of miracle or a sign and I love you all for that

Edit 2: I love you all, thanks for reaching out in my inbox, and I think this is the best gift I can ever ask

Coldplay Mumbai concert was attended by 60k people and I have more upvotes than that, that means there are more people here for me than they are there in the stadium. I am really thankful to you guys!

My post was deleted so I could not update you guys! I invited two friends to attend with me on concert and they agreed, a lot of things have been very positive with me in past few days and I thinks it’s all because of you guys!

I am not a YouTuber but I am definitely gonna make a video on this and upload it as my first video in the next 15 days cause this needs to be out their in the world, that Reddit is just amazing and how it can actually help people! Cause I don’t how to really thank you all guys!

Example 2:

I'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so I can forget he exists. I'm not sorry.
Custom
I can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. Lambast me if you wanr and maybe I even deserve it. I only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. Not what you think "people should" do. What you would REALLY do.

I'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. My husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. A very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. I can't see him EVER making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. I fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind.

We were told when I was pregnant that he would have Downs Syndrome. We could handle that. Even if it was severe. It turned out he has a chromosome deletion. His disorder is kind of rare so I won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been.

And what he is, is nothing.

He doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. His eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. He is total care. He is capable of nothing. He is tube fed and on oxygen. He is in diapers and will be forever. He makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. He never even really cried as a baby.

He has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment.

I'm not upset because I got a special needs/"imperfect" child. I feel the way I feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does NOTHING. I didn't get an imperfect child. I didn't get a child.

I don't love him. He doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. And yet I'm responsible for him. In addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. Respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his G tube, infections, pressure sores no matter WHAT we put him on or how we position him.

Our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. He's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. We do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. I was starting law school, I gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. My older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments.

The final straw was I heard a sound. I went into Younger Son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw Older Son hitting him and screaming "You're why I don't have a mother! You're why I don't have a father! You're why I can't have friends over! You're why I can't be in sports! I didn't ask for you and I hope you die!"

Instead of being horrified, I watched. And Younger Son just did. not. react. No signs of pain or fear or upset. No reaction at all.

He breathes but he is not alive. He doesn't know who I am. He doesn't know who Older Son is. He has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings.

He doesn't need to be in my home. He doesn't know or care where he is. He is genetically my son but he is not family. My previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my "child". In fact I was looking FORWARD to raising a Downs baby. Even one with severe impairments, for that reason. With disability can come gifts. This boy is not a gift. He is a genetic mistake I probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if I'd known he would be like this. And the flip side is, if he HAS awareness..... he's miserable. And there is nothing I can do. If he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. If he is in pain he can't tell anyone. If he wants anything, he can't communicate. He's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference.

And so he's leaving our home on the 29th. I feel excited and relieved and then guilty because I know we'll be happier with him gone.

He's already taken my husband and my son's father. He was working so so so much OT to pay for the cucumber's care. For the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. Because THIS one was going to be the BREAKTHROUGH. He was tired and defeated and disappointed. He sought counseling as well but I don't think he could ever say the words "I don't want my son in my home" either.

He's ruined my older son. I was so wrapped up on the younger I never realized how ignored and damaged he was. He lost his father too. I didn't just lose my husband. HE is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. At least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. At least they'll get a break from him when they punch out.

I just want to never think of him again and I'm not sorry. And for that, I'm sorry.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Thanks u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. Are you a medical doctor? If your Google Fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. That is the disorder my son has. I've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the PMs telling me to kill myself. If you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes they look like Downs. My insurance didn't cover AFP testing which would have told us it WASN'T Downs and I didn't think we needed it. I had a regular ultrasound and a 3D. Both Drs were "99% sure it was Downs".

This post was absolutely NOT fiction. Instead the mods and especially u/piconeeks just "decided" it was.

If anyone would like I'll doxx myself. You can see my ID to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. I will then link you to the news article of the "freak industrial accident" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person.

As for not choosing hospice for my son - I can't. About a year ago I myself was hospitalized with severe depression and C-PTSD (there is proof of that too). During that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. I'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. There are competency hearings. There are statements from doctors and evaluations. Unless SHE oks hospice, which she refuses, I cannot decide that. I have custody. I cannot ake medical decisions. She agreed to residential care which I feel is the second best option. So, he's going into residential care.

As for "mistaking" a child choking with hitting, I was downstairs. I couldn't hear what my older son was saying. I only knew he was speaking. Go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. Then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. They don't cough normally/forcefully. It's more a "strong puff". Similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. When you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes.

So, u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? Care to admit I just might be telling the truth? There were identify details I left out but guess y'all need them.

Example 3:

marrying for money sucks and I do not recommend it
Married a 40 year old when I was 19. Started dating when I was 17. Yes, it was gross but that's what happened. The only reason he married me is because I was hot. The only reason I married him is because he had money. I actually do have other redeeming characteristics but he married me because I was hot. I know this. Everyone knows this. It doesn't feel great but I can deal with it. We've been married 20 years. 4 kids. So we are stable and we have lots in common at this point. And we do love each other. But if I could go back and slap myself I would.

What nobody tells you- or they try and you don't listen because you're a dumbass teenager- is that marrying like this means you will fucking owe him. For everything. Every goddamn day. Not just in the bedroom but in every other matter in your life. The stuff you never imagined someone else trying to decide for you. And you don't just owe him for the money. It's a lot heavier than that. He'll never say it out loud. But you'll know the deal. Fundamentally unequal. He'll pull rank at the most random times and it will make you feel like you're falling through the floor.

I don't hate my life or anything. I accept that I made this bed and I have to lie in it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. My oldest daughter is two years younger than I was when I met my husband and I can't imagine.

Example 4:

Cop pulled me over and I called 911 and lied to get out of going to jail.
When I was 19 I was running late to work in my tiny POS economy car and on fumes of gas I didn’t come to a complete stop on a right turn. Lights behind me so I pull over. I know I’ve barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why I rolled through the stop a little. Trying not to have the car die.

At the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called Voicesteam (now TMoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. They were the first phones with caller ID and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn’t be triangulated or traced. Not that I cared but it stuck in my mind.

Well as I give the cop my license, registration and insurance card I got an idea. I knew if I was late to work I was going to lose my job. They were super strict there.

So I get an idea and right after I hand the papers to the cop and he’s walking back to his cruiser I called 911 and tell the operator I just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. I confirmed the address then I hung up.

About 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, “come to a complete stop next time!!” Then peels off to the direction of the store.

Pushed my car to the gas station that I’d almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity.

I was an idiot and I confess!

Edit: Wow, this blew up. I forgot to mention I would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because I was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and I had a bench warrant for it. Because I’m an idiot!

So it wouldn’t have been just a few mins late to work. The job was a physical high turn over one that didn’t tolerate much.

Thank you to the kind souls giving me these medals/awards! Don’t think I deserve them but I’ll pass it along to those who do!

Example 5:

I used to bully my disabled brother for years
Remorse
UPDATE:

A lot of people were asking for an update so here it is.

I wrote up a long ass apology letter that I wanted to read to my brother. I waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.

I knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. I couldn't even get through the first few words. I started crying after saying "I wanted to say I'm really sorry" and just couldn't get through it.

I just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. He hugged me really tight and said "I missed you buddy".

I fucking lost it. I never cried that bad before. He just hugged me for a long time until I calmed down. We didn't talk much. He started crying for a bit too. It was the first time in a long time we just hugged. After half an hour I got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. Why didn't I do this earlier, fuck.

I thought I could I try apologizing properly again tomorrow. I left him the note to read anyway.

I am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. I swear to God and on my own life I will never treat my brother so badly again.

I have been working part-time for the past year and I was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. But I think I will take my brother myself instead (when I turn 18).

I also realized that I need to have a relationship with my brother where I am not just taking care of him. It needs to be like a normal brother relationship. Like going for movies and stuff. It's going to take some time for me to fix the mess I created though. I'm just lucky my brother is amazing.

I received a lot of messages. I appreciate everyone for their input and I did read them all even if I didn't reply. Thanks everyone.

My actual post:

[Remorse]

I know this will get a lot of hate and yes I deserve it. I am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. I know I am a piece of human trash.

I just need to get this out.

I have a brother who is two years older then me. He has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. He cannot use his arms that well either.

We used to have a great relationship until I turned 11 and I really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. And how much stress he put them under.

I had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. I hated it.

There was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.

I realize now that I had no right to judge him and I will never know how difficult life is for him.

I stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. I would tell my family all the fun I was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.

I started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. He would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.

It started escalating two years ago when I would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.

I would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the DVR. I would make fun of his speech. Push things just out of his reach.

I would act disgusted when I had to change or bathe him. It always made him feel bad and he would apologize. I made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. What the fuck is wrong with me?

But my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. And he never let me have it.

Three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and I was just ignoring him. I got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. I fell asleep and realized I left him out there for three hours.

When I went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. He was humiliated.

I have always felt guilty about how I treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. But seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.

I stopped all the bullying after that day. I couldn't even look him in the face I was so ashamed.

Last Sunday my brother told me he was glad I was his brother and friend. I couldn't even respond. I went to my room and cried.

I'm fucking crying again typing this all out. When did I become an evil trash human being? Fuck.

I'm 17 and he's 19 now. I know there is nothing I can do to make up for the past 6 years.

My brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. I'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. I want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.

I am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. I am so ashamed of myself.

oh Son, believe me I know EXACTLY what you're going through. I'm 6 years older than my brother who has cerebral palsy; he's physically functional, but he has the mental capacity of an eight year old.

Until I was six I was a kid with a mother who gave me all the attention in the world. Then he was born. All the attention disappeared, childhood disappeared, and life became real, unkind, and challenging.

At sixteen my resentment for him was at it's peak; I was a hormonal teenager with my own issues, but due to his health and his need, my mother had to devote all of her time to him. I wanted for nothing, but for all intents and purposes, I craved attention and love to the point where I full on hated him. I never showed it as bluntly as you did, but it was there and burning.

I came out to my parents when I was sixteen, and I remember one night after having another round of fighting with my parents and being told some of the worst things a child could ever hear from his parents due to their inability to handle the fact that I was gay, I just went into my room, locked the door and cried.

As I was crying my brother came into the room, completely oblivious to the goings-on due to his inability to understand what it meant that I was gay. He sat on my bed and watched me cry. Then he put his hand on my leg and asked why I was crying.

I attempted to explain to him that I was gay, and what it meant, and how our parents were not very happy about it. Then he just said (which I will never forget).

"But does that mean that you are not going to be my brother anymore? Because that would be very sad. I love you Astro493. I really really do"

All the hatred died that day. I realized that to this perpetual child I would always be the hero big brother who had the responsibility to care for him, and even though it's challenging and he couldn't 'repay in kind,' his method of payment (Exactly like your brother) is unending love.

Its a rare and precious thing my friend. To know that you're loved. You're still very young so life hasn't shown you the value of love yet. I know that may seem like me jumping to a conclusion, but after having plowed through a couple more decades than yourself, I now realize it's the most damn important thing in the world.

Our lives are much harder than they "should have been." But we live our lives with strength and pride. He will always be challenging, but you will always be his brother, and he will always love you.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the gold/silver/platinum/comments of love....."he ain't heavy, he's my brother"

Example 6:

I run a fake restaurant on a delivery app.
I registered a company, bought all the take-away boxes from Amazon, signed up for a few delivery apps, made a few social media acounts and printed leaflets that I drop in mailboxes. I re-sell microwave meals...On some meals I add something to make them look better, like cheese. So far it’s at around £200 a day in revenue.

Nobody suspects a thing, soon someone will come for higene inspection, but I’ll pass that check without any problems. It’s not illegal to operate out of your own kitchen.

Should I feel bad? I feel kind of proud to be fair and free as a bird from the 9-5 life.

Edit: Please stop commenting on the legality of this. I’m doing everything by the law. I’m in the UK, so yes, I can work out of a non-commercial kitchen, yes I am registered and will pay taxes in Jan, yes I have my certificates and yes I have insurance (though there is something I might need to add to the policy, doing that next week)

This shouldn’t be your concern, I’m legal. This is a confession sub, not legal advice. Not breaking any laws, just ruining my karma irl for selling people heated up food from a microwave at home.

Example 7:

He is having fun avoiding parental responsibilities, but there is no child.
A guy I was dating intentionally tried to get me pregnant when we were together. After ejaculating into me when I asked him not to and he knew I was ovulating, he ghosted and I never heard from him again. I lied and told him he got me pregnant and he blocked me. I managed to reach out to him and told him I gave birth and he hung up on me. There is no child. 🤣

He unblocks me every couple of months to taunt me about being left with his child. But there is no child Imao. It's just funny to watch how much joy he gets out of thinking he created a child and disappeared.

Almost like it's a kink for him. I don't ever plan to tell him there's no child lol. I'm just going to let him enjoy feeling like he did something.

For those calling me crazy— I do have borderline personality disorder. So, it’s playtime 😈

Also, we weren’t using the pullout method. He was using a condom and decided to take it off quickly before he ejaculated and shove himself back inside of me to ejaculate, while I pushed on his chest, cried, and said “no” repeatedly. I didn’t deserve that, but he deserves this. And the fact that so many of you think that lying is worse than or equal to RAPE is fucking terrifying.

Example 8:

I stole over $20,000 in a very creative way in the 90's
No Regrets
I worked at a fast food chain in the 90's when I was in high school. When I worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) The way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. So if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. My manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards.

So my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when I was closing I found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. They were FILLED with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. So, I scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. After we closed, I came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. I counted them. There were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. None of them had expiration dates. Total haul was $40K in fast food certificates. My manager never said a word, he couldn't. He had reported them destroyed weeks earlier.

Over the next three years my girlfriend and I toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. We never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half.

After the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up.

I bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change. And for some reason A kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. We threw away a lot of kiddie cones.

Edit:

Holy crap this blew up. Here are the answers to some of the FAQs

We could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours. Both of us would use a gift cert. it was not that labor intensive.

The only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.

The manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.

Each gift certificate had a generic PLU on them. E.i. All the $25 were PLU #756.

When we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid. They were not coupons.

One can only eat so many ice cream cones.
